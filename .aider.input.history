+I'm trying to deploy to Netlify and got the following error: Diagnosis
+The build failure is caused by a missing dependency that is not specified in the package.json file.
+
+The relevant error lines in the build log are:
+
+Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'react' in '/opt/build/repo/src'
+Solution
+Verify Dependency in package.json: First, ensure that the react package is included as a dependency in the package.json file.
+
+If the react package is already included in the package.json file:
+
+Check that the node_modules directory is present. If not, run npm install to install dependencies.
+If the issue persists, you may need to consider adding react to the list of externals in the build configuration.

+Netlify deploy error: The build failure occurred due to an error in setting the Python version during the dependency installation stage.
+
+This can be seen from the error message python-build: definition not found: python-3.10.11 in line 11 and the subsequent errors related to installing core:python.
+
+Solution:
+
+Verify Python Version in the Project:
+
+Check that the required Python version, in this case, python-3.10.11, is correctly specified in the project configuration files.
+Environment Configuration:
+
+Ensure that the Python version 3.10.11 is properly defined in the configuration file, such as pyenv or .python-version.
+Node Version Mismatch:
+
+If using Netlify, ensure that the specified Node version in the project matches the version supported by Netlify. Refer to the documentation on managing Node.js versions.
+By confirming the correct Python version is specified and aligning it with the environment configuration, the Python dependency installation issue should be resolved.

+Im experiencing the following Netlify deploy error: Diagnosis: Based on the build logs, the error is related to setting the Python version during the build process.
+
+Solution:
+
+Python Version Issue: The build is failing due to an error in setting the Python version to 3.10.10.
+Verify Python Version: Verify that the required Python version (3.10.10) is correctly specified in the project configuration files or dependencies.
+Check Configuration: Ensure that the Python version is correctly defined in the project's configuration files like package.json or any build scripts.
+Node Version Mismatch: If the issue persists and involves Node version mismatches, refer to the documentation for changing Node versions to ensure compatibility.

# 2025-01-14 19:41:07.345305
+Diagnosis: The build failed during the stage of installing dependencies with the error message "python-build: definition not found: python-3.10.11".
+
+Solution: The issue is related to the Python version not being recognized during the build process. To resolve this error, you need to ensure that the specified Python version is available and properly defined. Here are the steps to fix the problem:
+
+Verify that the Python version 3.10.11 is correctly specified in the project configuration or dependencies.
+Check if the required Python version (3.10.11) is present in the pyenv setup or the .python-version file in the project repository.
+If the required Python version is missing, ensure it is added to the pyenv setup or the project configuration.
+If the Python version needs to be added to the build configuration, make sure that the version is correctly listed in the project's configuration files.
+If the issue persists, you may need to review the Python version configuration and ensure it is correctly set up for the build process.

The apps run correctly when running it via "npm run start" locally on this computer, but is not running following "netlify deploy". In particular the splashscreen and frontpages aren't rendered and there is no error message in the dev.console. Check the project and advise based on the readme file what is the best way to deploy this project. It seems to advocate using docker, I'm not sure why.

+Use Poetry‚Äôs installation script instead of pip. For example, in your package.json:
+
+```json
+{
+  "scripts": {
+    "build": "npm run build:py && npm run build:app && npm run build:css",
+    "build:py": "npm run build:wheel && npm run build:install-wheel",
+    "build:wheel": "curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - && export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\" && cd src/framework/processing/py && poetry build --format wheel",
+    "build:install-wheel": "cp -R src/framework/processing/py/dist/. ./public",
+    "build:app": "react-scripts build",
+    "build:css": "NODE_ENV=production tailwindcss build -i ./src/framework/styles.css -o ./build/styles.css --minify"
+  }
+}
+```
+
+This removes ‚Äúpip‚Äù usage and installs Poetry via its official script. Run ‚Äúvercel --prod‚Äù again.
